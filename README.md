Base code used to run the experiments published in: L. M. Berto, P. D. P. Costa, A. S. Simoes, R. R. Gudwin and E. L. Colombini, "An Iowa Gambling Task-based experiment applied to robots: A Study on Long-term Decision Making," 2021 IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL), 2021, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/ICDL49984.2021.9515632.

To change the gamma parameter of RL algorithm, use the Qlearning.java file.

After the paper we started develop some improvements, so part of the new codes are avaiable in files (more granular discretization of the environment, punishments at fixed schedules, etc, for example).
